    "# **1. Mathematical Foundations of Data Procesing**\n",
    "Raw ultrasonic data is inherently noisy due to air turbulence, surface reflections, and sensor jitter. Our DataProcessor pipeline applies a sequence of mathematical operations to extract the \"true\" geometry of the scanned object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **A. Median Filtering: Spike ELimination**\n",
    "The first line of defense is a **Median Filter**. It is exceptionally robust against \"impulse noise\" (outliers caused by faulty echos).\n",
    "- **The Math**: A window of size $ n = 3$ slides acros the signal. The center value is replaced by the median of all values within the window.\n",
    "- **The Benefit**: Unlike a simple mean (average), the median is not skewed by extreme outliers. This perserves the sharp edges of the object while removing random spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **B. Savitzky-Golay Filter: Smoothing without Distortion**\n",
    "This is the core of the signal refinement. Standard smoothing often \"rounds off\" sharp corners, which are vital for distinguishing a triangle from a circle.\n",
    "- **The Principle**: The filter performs a local polynomial regression (Degree 2) on a sliding window ($L = 11$). It uses the least-sqaures method to find the best fit.\n",
    "- **The Benefit**: It smooths the noise on flat surfaces but preserves the peaks and valleys (the \"corners\") much more accurately than a moving average.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **C. Linear Interpolation: Filling Data Gaps**\n",
    "Physical outliers (distance $> 15cm$) are dropped, creating `Nan` gaps.\n",
    "- **The Math**: $y = y_1 + (x - x_1)\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$\n",
    "- **The Application**: We connect the points before and after the gap with a straight line. This ensures a continuous signal, which is required for the Neural Network's mathematical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **2. Neural Network Architecture: Multi-Scale 1D-CNN**\n",
    "To achieve high accuracy, we utilize a **Multi-Scale Convolutional Architecture**. Instead of a single path, the network looks at the data through different \"lenses\" simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **A. 1D-Convolutional Layers**\n",
    "The CNN applies filters to the 163-point scan.\n",
    "- **Kernel Sizes**: We use kernels like 3, 7 and 15.\n",
    "    - *Small Kernels (3)*: Detect fine details and sharp corners.\n",
    "    - *Large Kernels (15)*: Recognize broad geometric patterns and long flat edges.\n",
    "- **Batch Normalization**: This normalizes the activations of the neurons, significantly speeding up the training and preventing \"vanishing gradients\".\n",
    "\n",
    "## **B. Global MaxPooling: Rotational Invariance**\n",
    "This is a critical step for a rotating scanner.\n",
    "- **The Operation**: It extracts the maximum value from each feature map across the entire scan.\n",
    "- **The Logic**: It doesn't matter *where* the corner of the triangle is (at 10° or 190°). The Max-Pooling ensures that the network recognizes the *existance* of the feature regardless of its orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **3. High-End Optimization Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **A. Bayesian Optimization**\n",
    "Intstead of a random search, we use a Bayesian Oracle. It builds a probability model of the objective function and chooses the next hyperparameters to test based on past results. It balances:\n",
    "- **Exploration**: Trying new, unknown architecture configurations.\n",
    "- **Exploitation**: Refining configurations that have already shown high accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **B. 5-Fold Cross-Validation**\n",
    "To ensure our 95%+ accuracy isn't just a \"lucky split\", we divide the data into 6 parts. The model is trained 5 times, each time using a different part for validation. The final score is the average of all 5 runs, ensuring absolute robustness.\n"
